#We can specify variables in foll ways

Eg.
1. Under yml file
vars:
  java_package: openjdk-11-jdk
  tomcat_username: tomcat
  tomcat_home: /opt/tomcat
  tomcat_shell: /bin/false
  tomcat_version: '9.0.54'

2. specifying file name under yml .create a file under vars folder if the ansible playbook is complex or else create under same location where yml file is present
vars_files:
    - defaults.yml

3. Creating group and host level variables
we need to create group folder for groupl level variables and host folder for host level variable
#both folder should be where host file is present
#In host_var folder create file with the name of the host
#In group_var folder create file with the name of the group which is specified under group
for folder level vars check below link
